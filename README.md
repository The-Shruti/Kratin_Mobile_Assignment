# Project:
The provided code consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components to create a web application designed to assist Sunita Sharma in managing her daily health routines. Below is a description of each part of the code:

### HTML Structure (`index.html`)

- **Title and Meta Information**: The document starts with the declaration and sets the character set to UTF-8. It includes the title "Daily Health Reminder for Sunita" and links to the external CSS stylesheet.
- **Body Content**: Inside the `<body>` tags, the content includes a welcome message and a reminder container. There's a series of buttons representing different times of the day when Sunita should focus on specific health routines.
- **JavaScript Link**: At the end of the body, there's a link to an external JavaScript file (`script.js`) for functionality.

### CSS Styling (`styles.css`)

- **Background and Font Styling**: The CSS defines a background image related to health, sets the font family to Arial, and provides padding for spacing.
- **Header Styling**: Headers (`h1` and `h2`) are centered, and specific colors are applied: black for the welcome message ("Welcome, Sunita Sharma!") and a faint black (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)`) for "Daily Health Reminder."
- **Reminder Container**: The reminder container has a light background color (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)`), rounded corners, and a shadow effect for a card-like appearance.
- **Button Styling**: The buttons are styled with padding, font size, background color (`#4CAF50`), and hover effects to indicate interactivity.
- **Responsive Design**: The design includes responsive elements such as max-width and margin settings to ensure proper alignment and spacing across various screen sizes.

### JavaScript Functionality (`script.js`)

- **Routine Display**: The JavaScript file contains functions to display different routines based on the time selected by clicking the buttons.
- **Time-Based Routines**: Routines such as waking up, medication times, meals, and exercises are predefined for specific times of the day.
- **Dynamic Content**: Upon clicking a button corresponding to a time slot, the associated routine is displayed in the reminder container, providing Sunita with guidance on her health activities throughout the day.

### Overall Description

The integrated code aims to offer Sunita Sharma a user-friendly web application that provides reminders and guidance for her daily health routines. The interface includes a visually appealing design with a health-related background image, clear text styling, and interactive buttons. The JavaScript functionality enables Sunita to view specific health routines based on the time of day, helping her maintain a balanced and healthy lifestyle.
